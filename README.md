Look Scanned is a pure frontend site that makes your PDFs look scanned! No need for printers and scanners anymore - everything you need to do is just a few clicks. Inspired by [baicunko/scanyourpdf](https://github.com/baicunko/scanyourpdf).

This fork removes web fonts that were loaded from third party servers. This prevents the user's IP from being shared with other servers, making the site GDPR compliant.
